# Phishing Email Simulation Training

This repository is part of the Microsoft Virtual Internship on Forage, focusing on creating a phishing email training and awareness program. The context behind this project is that a previous phishing email simulation was not successful because the email did not look legitimate enough to effectively raise awareness.

## Task 1: Craft a Phishing Email Simulation

### **Context:**  
The task at hand is to craft a phishing email simulation designed to raise awareness about one of the most common threats organizations face today: phishing attacks.

In Task 1, we are crafting a more convincing phishing email that could be used in training exercises to help individuals recognize phishing attempts and understand how to protect themselves from falling victim to such attacks.

### **Email Details**

**From:** IT Security Team (security-alerts@mastercard-secure.com)  
**To:** employee@email.com  
**Subject:** Immediate Action Required: Suspicious Activity Detected

### **Body:**

Dear [Employee's Name],

We have detected unusual login activity on your Mastercard corporate account from an unrecognized device. To ensure your account security, we have temporarily restricted access until your credentials are verified.

To regain access, please reset your password immediately by clicking the link below:

[Reset Password Securely](https://www.mastercard-secure.com.update-account.com/login)

## Task 2: Interpret Phishing Simulation Results

### **Context:**
The phishing simulation designed in Task 1 was run last week. So, whatâ€™s next?

Weâ€™ve used some tools to analyze the results and we can see the failure rate of each department - it is clear that some teams appear more likely to fall for a phishing email than others.

Now that we have these results, we need to:
- Identify which areas of the business need more awareness about phishing.
- Design and implement the appropriate training for those teams to lower our risk of an attack.

### **Phishing Campaign Results**

This table helps to identify which teams appear to be more likely to fall for a phishing email than others.

| Team          | Email Open Rate | Email Click-Through Rate | Phishing Success Rate |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| IT           | 80%            | 2%                      | 0%                   |
| HR           | 100%           | 85%                     | 75%                  |
| Card Services | 60%           | 50%                     | 10%                  |
| Reception    | 40%            | 10%                     | 0%                   |
| Engineering  | 70%            | 4%                      | 1%                   |
| Marketing    | 65%            | 40%                     | 38%                  |
| R&D          | 50%            | 5%                      | 2%                   |
| **Overall Average** | **66%** | **28%** | **18%** |

The percentages shown are based on the total number of staff members who received the email.

For example, if 100 people received the email and 50 people opened it, the email open rate would be 50%.
- **Email open rate** = Percentage of people that opened it.
- **Email click-through rate** = Percentage of people that clicked on the link.
- **Phishing success rate** = Percentage of people that clicked the link and inputted some personal information.

## **Phishing Awareness Training Slides**

### **Slide 1: Familiarize Yourself with Phishing Attacks**
#### **High-Risk Teams: HR & Marketing**
- Based on our phishing simulation, these teams were most susceptible.
- This training will help you **recognize and avoid phishing threats.**
- Stay vigilant to protect our organization's security.

---

### **Slide 2: What is Phishing?**
- **Phishing** is a **social engineering attack** used to steal sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy source.
- Cybercriminals often target employees via:
  - **Emails** that look legitimate but contain malicious links.
  - **Fake websites** designed to capture login credentials.
  - **Urgent messages** tricking users into quick action.
- **Example:** An email claiming your account is compromised and urging you to reset your password immediately.

---

### **Slide 3: Learn to Spot Phishing Emails**
#### **Key Signs of Phishing Emails:**
- **Suspicious Sender:** The senderâ€™s email address is slightly altered (e.g., `security@mastercard-secure.com` instead of `security@mastercard.com`).
- **Urgency & Threats:** "Immediate action required! Your account will be locked!"
- **Poor Grammar & Spelling:** Phishing emails often have noticeable errors.
- **Mismatched URLs:** Hover over links before clicking! A link that claims to be `mastercard.com` might actually be `mastercard-login.secure-update.com`.
- **Unusual Attachments:** Unexpected invoices, receipts, or password-protected files.

---

### **Slide 4: How to Stop Getting Phished**
- **Think Before You Click:** Hover over links to check authenticity.
- **Verify the Sender:** If in doubt, contact IT or the sender directly.
- **Report Suspicious Emails:** Use the companyâ€™s phishing report tool or forward to IT Security.
- **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Even if your password is stolen, MFA can prevent access.
- **Stay Updated on Phishing Tactics:** Regular security awareness training will keep you informed.
