# Phishing Email Simulation Training

This repository is part of the Microsoft Virtual Internship on Forage, focusing on creating a phishing email training and awareness program. The context behind this project is that a previous phishing email simulation was not successful because the email did not look legitimate enough to effectively raise awareness.

**Context:**  
The task at hand is to craft a phishing email simulation designed to raise awareness about one of the most common threats organizations face today: phishing attacks.

In Task 1, we are crafting a more convincing phishing email that could be used in training exercises to help individuals recognize phishing attempts and understand how to protect themselves from falling victim to such attacks.
